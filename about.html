                <strong>A few words about me</strong><br>
                My name is Eugene. I study programming and astronomy because I dream of working in these fields. I work hard every day to bring this dream closer to reality. 
				<br>
				I’m fluent in Russian, English, and Spanish. I love studying, building projects, and reaching for the stars — both figuratively and literally. Space fascinates me, and so does the logic of code. I see no contradiction in having my head in the stars and hands on the keyboard.
